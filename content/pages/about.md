I’ve now reached the honorable age of 42. I live in a small town called Kävlinge in Sweden with Anna which will be my wife in the future. My roots are from Simrishamn where I lived about 25 years until I decided to go for a masters degree education in computer science. I’m currently employed at Linaro where I am the head of Security Working Group.
