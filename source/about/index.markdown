I’ve now reached the honorable age of 36. I live in a small town called Kävlinge in Sweden with Anna which will be my wife in the future. My roots are from Simrishamn where I lived about 25 years until I decided to go for a masters degree education in computer science.
I’m currently employed at [Linaro](http://linaro.org) where I am the Tech Lead of Security Working Group.
