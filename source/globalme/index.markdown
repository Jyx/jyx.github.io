This is a helper script for [GNU Global](http://www.gnu.org/software/global) on
Windows. On some occasions you might have your source code on a write protected
media. Then it's a bit tricky to setup GNU Global. I don't know why it have to
be tricky like this. The developers should have made an easy command line
switch for it.

This small Perl script will auto generate bat-files that in turn will setup all
necessary path etc for you to be able to use GNU Global on Windows. The script
is working for both normal Command prompt and if you are using Cygwin (1.5.2
was the latest version I tested this on).

**Language**: Perl

**Status**: Done for the moment.
