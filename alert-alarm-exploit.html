<h2>tl;dr;</h2>
<p>For less tech savvy people or people just bored about all the details, this
tl;dr; and the <a class="reference internal" href="#summary">summary</a> section at the end should be enough to read to get an
understanding of the issues.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As of today, 2020-01-02, the issues presented here still haven't been fixed
even though initial report date was July 3rd 2019.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.alertalarm.se">Alert Alarm</a> is a Swedish company selling burglar alarms (with various
possibilities for extensions) to home owners. At one of their pages [<a class="reference external" href="https://www.alertalarm.se/hemlarm/garanti-och-funktion.html#1">1</a>],
they are saying that: &quot;Our burglar alarms for home owners communicate using
an encrypted channel primarily using GSM and secondarily using SMS&quot;.
Apparently there is also some collaboration with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.verisure.se/">Verisure</a> since the people
that I've been in contact with after reporting the issue to Alert Alarm are
coming from Verisure.</li>
<li>It all started out one morning in June 2019 when I noticed that when turning
of the alarm from the App, a SMS was generated where the content was a long
(hex-)string with random characters. After doing some reverse engineering I
found out that Alert Alarm have multiple weaknesses in their SMS
implementation that are used when turning on/off alarms from their Alert Alarm
app (tested on Android). The weaknesses can be summaries in:<ul>
<li>Crypto algorithm in use is plain AES-CBC which is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)">malleable</a>.</li>
<li>No integrity protection of the encrypted messages.</li>
<li>Heavily reduced key space, from 128-bits to 9999 keys.</li>
<li>Doesn't use any device unique values/properties in the data being sent to
the Alert Alarm server.</li>
<li>No key derivation function in use (KDF).</li>
<li>No key exchange protocol in use (like Diffie Hellman for example).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This makes the security of the implementation very fragile, since all it
takes for a rouge user is to get hold of a <strong>single</strong> SMS generated by the
Alert Alarm app to be able to gain access to someones house. I.e., when the
attacker got that he can easily figure out the code used to turn on/off the
burglar alarm. Using free services one can send <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=send+spoofed+sms&amp;oq=send+spoofed+sms">spoofed SMS</a> with manually
crafted data and then it's just to enter the victims house and no alarm will
go off. Alternatively a thief can break into the house and just simply enter
the code to turn off the alarm as the homeowner would do.</li>
<li>On this page, one can find examples and a script that can decrypt Alert Alarm
SMSes and also create valid Alert Alarm SMSes. The script is also capable of
finding a key using a brute force attack and it's also possible to flip bits
to change the original intention of the SMS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Observation</h2>
<p>As mentioned, this caught my attention when I noticed that when turning off an
active alarm (<tt class="docutils literal">ARMED_HOME</tt>) using the Android app, a SMS is created similar to
this (had to blur parts of it, otherwise anyone could figure out my own code by
just running the scripts presented here).</p>
<div class="align-center figure">
<img alt="SMS image" src="/images/alert/aa_initial_sms.png" />
</div>
<p>After spending the rest of the morning reverse engineering the app I could see
that the 64 bytes hex string is made up of two parts. The first part is the IV,
which is a random number (coming from <tt class="docutils literal">SHA1PRNG</tt>) and the second part is the
actual message.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   32 bytes   32 bytes
+-----------+----------+
| IV        | Message  |
+-----------+----------+
</pre></div>
<p>It uses a 128-bit key, however the key used for encryption are made up of
strings like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>000000000000xxxx
</pre></div>
<p>Where &quot;xxxx&quot; is the pin code that is used to turn on and off the burglar alarm.
This means the key space is heavily reduced from 128-bits, to only 9999
combinations instead of 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 combinations as
it would have been if they had used a proper key!</p>
<p>The message it self is encrypted using plain <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_Block_Chaining_(CBC)">AES-CBC</a>, so no integrity
protection or anything. What that means is that although the SMS is encrypted
anyone can still modify it without the receiver noticing that. I'll talk more
about that further down in the examples about flipping bits (see the section:
&quot;Flip a bit in the encrypted message&quot;).</p>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<div class="section" id="message-format">
<h3>Message format</h3>
<p>The format of the decrypted message is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Bytes:            1   1   1      2       1     2        2        2         2          2   = 16 bytes
        +-----------+---+---+------+---------+-----+------+--------+---------+----------+
        |SMS Version| i | j | year | month-1 | day | hour | minute | user id | \x00\x00 |

                                      (hex)
</pre></div>
<p>Here &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>&quot; seems to represent the &quot;<cite>alarm off (0)</cite>&quot; and &quot;<cite>alarm on (1)</cite>&quot; and
&quot;<tt class="docutils literal">j</tt>&quot; is probably whether it is &quot;<cite>armed home</cite>&quot; or &quot;<cite>armed away</cite>&quot;.</p>

<h2>Script</h2>
<p>On my GitHub page, you'll find a Python script (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Jyx/alert_alarm_xploit/blob/master/aaxploit.py">aaxploit.py</a>) that I wrote as
a proof of concept script. With that script you can generate valid Alert Alarm
SMSes, brute force SMS to get the code to the burglar alarm and a couple of other
things that I'll go more into detail separately below. Calling the script with
no arguments lists all possible parameters. But to make it easier to follow
along, we've put together a couple of examples below.</p>

<h3>Generate a SMS from scratch</h3>
<p>This creates a valid SMS message (hex string), i.e, a real usable string that
can be sent as an SMS and that will either turn on or turn off the alarm. &quot;-p&quot;
here is the code that you want to use. If you own an Alert Alarm system, then
you can try this, put your own and known code after &quot;-p&quot; and use either &quot;--on&quot;
or &quot;--off&quot; to arm or disarm the alarm. Then take the crafted SMS and send it as
an SMS to +467190009972713.</p>

<h3>Brute force an encrypted SMS</h3>
<p>Here we pretend that we <strong>don't</strong> know the key (i.e., the pin code to turn
on/off the alarm), but we somehow have gotten hold of the encrypted SMS. By
running the brute force attack we try to find the correct key and pin to turn
on/off the alarm. Due to the nature of how the message is encoded, this always
seems to work and since the key space is very small, it finds the key/pin in
less than a second.</p>

<p>As we can see, we found the correct key/pin code! Note that the pin code is the
same as used on the real physical burglar alarm at the alarm owners house. I.e.,
if a thief breaks in, he can enter this pin code and the alarm never goes off.</p>

<h3>Flip a bit in the encrypted message</h3>
<p>Since AES-CBC is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)">malleable</a>, we can flip a bit in the IV which will be directly
reflected on the decrypted message. I.e., a man in the middle can use this to
either change a message from &quot;Turn on alarm&quot; to a &quot;Turn off alarm&quot; or vice
versa. Notice that here one doesn't even have to decrypt the message, i.e, by
just taking the original message and flip a bit and use the modified SMS is
enough to turn off (or turn on) the alarm. In the example below we flip the

<p>Note that bit-flipping can be done to anything in the data, i.e., it would
probably work to trick the system by taking an old valid SMS created by the

people developing the app.</li>
<li>Verisure's Information Security Manager try to contact me using first phone
and then email.</li>
<li>I send over the report (basically this blog post) together with proof of
concept scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Augusti 12th 2019</strong>: Phone meeting with Verisure, I get a status update and
Verisure mentions that they need more time than standard 90-day disclosure
time, something that I'm fine with.</li>
<li><strong>October 2nd 2019</strong>: I reach out to Verisure asking for an update. Message is that
they are still working on a solution, testing &quot;something&quot; that should work and
that they soon will let me know more about it. I also ask about CVE number and
when we can go public with this. No answer to that.</li>
<li><strong>November 4th 2019</strong>: I reach out once again asking for an update.</li>
<li><strong>November 7th 2019</strong>: Verisure replies with more or less the same message as
October 2nd. Again promises to get back to me soon.</li>
<li><strong>2:nd January 2020</strong>: I'm cleaning up the write-up and publish all this. The
reason for doing it today is because today it's half a year ago since I
initially reported the issues to Alert Alarm. If they would have been serious
about this, it should all have been fixed by now and they should have
reconnected better with me.</li>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The security of the solution relies on</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the pin code and</li>
<li>the SMS senders phone number and</li>
<li>that no-one is able to get hold of the SMS sent.</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, one can argue that <strong>the security only relies on &quot;3&quot;</strong>, since if one
gets hold of &quot;3&quot;, then it's trivial to figure out &quot;1&quot;, that is basically what
the script <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Jyx/alert_alarm_xploit/blob/master/aaxploit.py">aaxploit.py</a> does. &quot;2&quot; on the other hand is typically available
in phone books etc, i.e., it's usually not hard to figure out the phone numbers
to the owner of a house.</p>
<p>Alert Alarm seems to have tried to &quot;lock&quot; the SMS service to a set of users.
i.e., the first user have to add additional phone numbers before these people
can use the app. So at first glance, one might believe that it's only the
owners of these phone numbers who can send the SMS. But the fact is that there
are many services out there that allow you to send <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=send+spoofed+sms&amp;oq=send+spoofed+sms">spoofed SMS</a> so it looks
like they were sent from a certain phone number. I.e., it's totally possible to
craft a SMS using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Jyx/alert_alarm_xploit/blob/master/aaxploit.py">aaxploit.py</a> and then use one of these services to send a
rouge SMS. I.e., any user can turn off the alarm without the alarm owner knowing
about it.</p>
<p><strong>Should the owners of this alarm be worried?</strong> Getting an SMS from the home
owner is probably a bit challenging, so it's probably a bit hard to actually do
the attack (don't leave your phone unattended!). On the other hand if Alert
Alarm <strong>doesn't</strong> notice brute force attacks on the receiving side of the SMS,
then it's fairly easy to put this attack into practice.</p>
<p>No matter, the flaws identified are quite severe and gives an attacker several
ways to attack the system. Attacks that shouldn't be possible to do that easy on
a system meant to protect our homes. Me and the other customers of Alert Alarm
don't want our burglar alarms to have these kind of weaknesses. Right now it's
more <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">Security by Obscurity</a> than real security.</p>
