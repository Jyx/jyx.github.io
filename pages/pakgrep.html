    <h1 class="entry-title">Pakgrep</h1>
    
    <h1>What is pakgrep?</h1>
<p>Pakgrep is a program that allows you to extract files from a Quake2 pak-file.
For you that doesn't know what a pak-file is you could compare them with
zip-files but for the game Quake2 instead. I.e. the pak files contains textures
for game levels, skins for the models, sound for your models and maps. I could
contain config files and background picture when showing the console. Pakgrep
is written in C and supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a> as search string.</p>
<h1>Why pakgrep?</h1>
<p>During all the years I played Quake2 I created a pak-file for myself which
contained all goodies that I liked. I had nice textures, good sounds and our
own ergo Gibbus background and a text font that I really liked. One day when I
was re-installing Windows I did a mistake deleted my Quake2 folder by mistake.
Not a big deal I thought until I realized that my pak-file was missing. I had a
lot of pak-files backed up, but not my own. However it should be possible for
me to recreate it again by copy and paste files from other pak-files. But to do
that you had to open/extract every single pak-file, browse the extracted files
and then decide if it was the file you were looking for. A quite time consuming
task. I especially wanted to find the conchars.pcx file which contains the font
showed in the game. I decided to create a small program that could extract the
files and this is what it ended up with, i.e. pakgrep.</p>
<h1>How to use it</h1>
<ol>
<li>It is made for Windows and I have used it on WinXP (32) and Windows (64).</li>
<li>Copy pakgrep.exe to a folder containing pak-files (*.pak).</li>
<li>Type pakgrep.exe files_to_search_for pakfile.pak.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example to search for and extract conchars.pcx files from pak9.pak you could write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">    pakgrep.exe conc* pak9.pak</span>
</pre></div>


<p>On the pakfile I tried when writing this I got the following result</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">c</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">pakgrep</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">pakgrep</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">exe</span> <span class="n">conc</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">pak9</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pak</span>
    <span class="n">Pakgrep</span> <span class="n">v1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="k">by</span> <span class="n">Joakim</span> <span class="n">Bech</span>

    <span class="n">Extracting</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">pics</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">conback</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pcx</span>
    <span class="n">Extracting</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">pics</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">conchars</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pcx</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I.e. the search string matched both conback.pcx and conchars.pcx.</p>
